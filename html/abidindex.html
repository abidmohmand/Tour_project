              The geography of Pakistan is a blend of landscapes varying from
              plains to deserts, forests, hills, and plateaus ranging from the
              coastal areas of the Arabian Sea in the south to the high
              mountains of central Asia in the north. The Himalayas and
              Karakorams are the world’s newest mountains formed as a result of
              a collision between the Indian geological plate and the Asian
              plate. The Karakoram Range is about 500 km in length and the most
              heavily glaciated part of the world outside the polar region.
              Pakistan has the densest concentration of high mountains in the
              world with five peaks over 8,000 meters, including K2, the
              second-highest mountain on Earth.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the north of Pakistan, there is another great mountain range of
              the Hindu Kush which is 800 km long and stretches between central
              Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. The highest point in the Hindu
              Kush is Tirich Mr (7,708 m) towering above the Chitral Valley in
              Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The mountain range separates Central
              Asia from South Asia. In the north of Pakistan, there is another
              great mountain range of the Hindu Kush which is 800 km long and

              highest point in the Hindu Kush is Tirich Mr (7,708 m) towering

          The Indus River is Pakistan’s lifeline and with its tributaries
          provide water for the largest irrigation system in the world. The
          Indus is 3,200 kilometers long and is the third-longest river in Asia.
          Rising in Tibet, it passes through Ladakh in northern India and enters
          Pakistan flowing northwestwards. The Indus separates the Himalaya and
          Karakoram ranges, plunging through some of the world’s deepest gorges
          as it twists between the mountains until it finally finds an exit
          south to the plains of Punjab and Sindh. The Indus River is Pakistan’s

          According to a famous travel writer, ” Never let your memories be
          greater than your dreams. For me, Pakistan is such a destination which
          makes it possible….” Pakistan is blessed with four seasons, diverse
          culture, vivid colors, and romance that increases gradually. Pakistan
          is considered a Holy name as it’s named as which means pure land.
          Pakistan nestles in the valleys of the ever-evolving grand Karakorum
          ranges. The country is bordered by the Arabian Sea and the Indian
          ocean. Neighboring countries are Afghanistan, India, Iran, and China.
          Pakistan had mighty mountains, adjacent points, and 3M junctions in
          the North with an incredible landscape. Pakistan is home to historical
          mosques, cold and hot deserts, natural caves, lakes, and palm-fringed
          beaches.<br />
